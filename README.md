# supply-chain-demand-prediction-supervised-learning
End-to-end supervised ML project focused on demand prediction in supply chains, covering data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.By framing demand prediction as a classification problem, this project demonstrates how machine learning can support data-driven decision-making in real-world supply chain operations.
# Supply Chain Demand Prediction (Supervised ML)

##  Problem Statement
Accurately predicting daily demand is critical for inventory planning, logistics optimization, and cost reduction in supply chains.  
This project formulates demand prediction as a **supervised classification problem** by discretizing continuous demand values into demand categories.

##  Dataset
- Supply chain operational dataset
- Target variable: **Daily Demand**
- Features include logistics, inventory, and operational indicators

##  Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Feature engineering and encoding  
3. Demand discretization (continuous → categorical)  
4. Model training and validation  
5. Performance evaluation  

##  Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  

##  Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix
