# supply-chain-demand-prediction-supervised-learning
End-to-end supervised ML project focused on demand prediction in supply chains, covering data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.By framing demand prediction as a classification problem, this project demonstrates how machine learning can support data-driven decision-making in real-world supply chain operations.
